                The project inputs a .csv file of houses for sale, and returns a line chart of the average house price 
                per decade the house was built (from 1900's to 2010's). Given how housing prices are rising, the motivation
                behind this project was to help potential homeowners in their search to find a home they can afford.

                The program creates a Pandas Dataframe of the housing data, then creates smaller dataframes of all houses
                built in each decade. The program then uses pandas to calculate the mean housing price for all decades,
                then uses Matplotlib's Pyplot package to create line or bar charts for those mean housing prices.

            <p>
                The main challenge for this project was creating the smaller dataframes for each decade.
                I solved this challenge using Pandas' built-in dataframe organizing and filtering methods, then 
                creating lists to manage results.

            <p>
                In the future, I could add a UI to more easily allow users to enter data and choose their preferred output.
                I may also add the ability to analyze housing price by other parameters (such as square footage
                or number of rooms)
